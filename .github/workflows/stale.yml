          stale-pr-message: |
            This PR is stale because it has not had any recent activity. The resources of the project maintainers are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

            If you feel that the PR is still relevant in the latest release, consider making the PR easier to review and finding developers to help review the PR.

            Please be _mindful_ that although we encourage PRs, we cannot expand the scope of the project in every possible direction. There will be requests that don't make the roadmap.

            This PR will automatically close in 10 dasys if no further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.
